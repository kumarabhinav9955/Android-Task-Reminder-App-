Project Overview: Android Task Reminder App

This project is focused on developing a Task Scheduler application for Android using a combination of essential tools and concepts in Android app development.

Android Studio and its Tools:
The project leverages Android Studio as the primary integrated development environment. This powerful tool provides a comprehensive suite of features for coding, debugging, and testing Android applications, ensuring a streamlined development process.

XML Designing and Resource Files:
XML is used extensively to design the app's user interface. Layout XML files define the structure of screens, while resource files house content such as text, colors, and images. This separation of content from code enhances maintainability and customization.

Object-Oriented Programming:
Object-oriented programming principles play a crucial role in creating a modular and organized application. Classes and objects are used to model various app components, enabling a more structured and maintainable codebase.

Basic SQL Knowledge:
The app employs a local SQLite database, requiring basic knowledge of SQL for database operations. CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are implemented to manage and store task-related data.

Android Activities:
Activities represent the app's various screens and interactions. The project involves creating and managing activities to control the user experience, ensuring a smooth flow through the app. Understanding the Android Activity lifecycle is essential for effective
state management.

Java:
Java serves as the primary programming language for the project, providing a solid foundation for building Android applications. Java code is used to implement the app's logic and functionality, making it interactive and user-friendly.

In conclusion, this project involves the development of an Android Task Scheduler app, using Android Studio and a combination of XML for user interface design, object-oriented programming for modularity, SQL knowledge for database operations, Android activities
for screen management, and Java for application logic. These elements collectively contribute to the creation of a feature-rich and user-friendly Android app for task scheduling and management.
